    "What is Transfer Learning?\n",
    "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused as the starting point for a new, often related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, a pre-trained model (usually trained on a large dataset like ImageNet) is fine-tuned or used as a feature extractor for solving a specific problem.\n",

    "How Does Transfer Learning Help in Solving Advanced Problems?\n",
    "Speeds Up Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained models already understand basic features like edges, textures, and patterns. Using this knowledge reduces the time required for training compared to starting from scratch.\n",
    "Reduces Data Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is particularly useful when labeled data for the target task is limited, as the pre-trained model's knowledge generalizes well to similar problems.\n",
    "Improves Accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Models pre-trained on large datasets have learned robust feature representations, which can significantly improve the performance of the target task.\n",
    "Handles Computational Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training a model on massive datasets, which requires significant resources, transfer learning allows leveraging pre-trained models efficiently.\n",
    "Facilitates Domain Adaptation:\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps in adapting knowledge from one domain (e.g., generic object recognition) to another (e.g., medical image analysis), where the datasets may differ in scale or characteristics.\n",

    "Write briefly about semantic segmentation and instance segmentation ? Name one architecture used for each of these segmentation types. ?\n",
    "Semantic Segmentation\n",
    "Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, categorizing all pixels into predefined classes. It focuses on identifying and segmenting regions in the image belonging to specific classes, but it does not distinguish between different instances of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Segmenting all cars in an image as \"car\" without differentiating between individual cars.\n",
    "Architecture: U-Net is a widely used architecture for semantic segmentation, known for its encoder-decoder structure.\n",
    "Instance Segmentation\n",
    "Instance segmentation not only assigns class labels to each pixel but also differentiates between individual instances of the same class. It combines object detection with semantic segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Identifying multiple cars in an image and segmenting each car as a separate entity.\n",
    "Architecture: Mask R-CNN is a popular architecture for instance segmentation, which extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting masks.\n",
